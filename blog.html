                <p>In the fall of 2016, I organized a trip to Smolyan with my section back in Grade 9. We went to Smolyan and we had a wonderful trip filled with many new experiencies and memories. On the last day, we were all in a single room, playing <em> Truth or Dare</em> and drinking some whiskey. Yet, we were acting a bit foolish as we screamed and imitated moaning. Of course, our English teacher came at 4.30 am, yelling at us in the angriest way possible. Then, we were a bit screwed as she cancelled several of the activities we were going to do on the next day. Not only did this happen, but three of the boys went in the woods at 3.30 am exploring the hut where a homeless man had been sleeping. Fortunately, they were never caught! </p>

                <h2 id="bucharest">An unforgettable night in Bucharest</h2>
                <h6 class="date">Posted on November 13, 2019</h6>
                
                <p>It was 1 am and we decided to go for a walk outside. We went out and we explored the city of Bucharest for the next hour and a half until we thought about going to a piano bar. Yet, we did not find a good bar. What would three 18-year-old boys want to do? Many answers may arise, however, we wanted to have some new experiences and we visited a strip bar... Well, it was not as entertaining as we had thought before. We stayed there for an hour and then, we went for a walk. There was only a single problem: we were given beers that had some sort of drugs put inside. We did not really know where we were in that night. We were hungry and we walked for an hour to McDonalds where we ate at 4.30 am. After that we were extremely tired and we ordered an Uber that was to drive us home. As we got into the elevator of the block, we fell asleep over each other. And of course, the night ended.</p>
