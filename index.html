                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p class="text">My name is Martin Palikarsky and I am 18 years old. I am a senior at the American College of Sofia from section 12/3. I study Informatics profile for the third year. I am a senator of my grade level and a section representative as well. I deal with the organization of multiple events that benefit the College in a way. Also, I have been part in the ACS Musical for the past five years and I have always been the male leading roles, just like this year as Billy Flynn in <em>Chicago</em>.</p>
                <h2>My Informatics classes</h2>

                <p class="text">This year we learned a lot of things about the usage of HTML and CSS. We used Khan Academy which provided us with all the information about these languages. I found the course really successful as I am now able to produce this site on my own which shows that I have comprehended the material. In addition to that I found the classes really engaging and interactive as we were working during the entire time, aiming at producing this project in the end of the course.
